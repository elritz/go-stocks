# Introduction to GO with Postgres and Gorilla Mux: Building a RESTful Stocks API

#### Exploring GO by building a RESTful server create CRUD functionality for a stocks api.

In this project, I embark on a journey into Go programming (Golang). My objective is to construct a RESTful server that will serve as the backbone for a Stocks API, complete with CRUD functionality.

### What to Expect:
Throughout this project, I start to dive deep into Go, exploring its standard library, syntax, and best practices. I will also leverage PostgreSQL to create, update, retrieve, and delete stock data, providing a comprehensive overview of CRUD operations. By the end, you'll have a strong foundation in Go, RESTful API development, and working with a postgres database and with SQL.


### The Tech Stack:

- Go (Golang): The core of our project, Go, will handle the server-side logic efficiently.
- PostgreSQL: As our database of choice, PostgreSQL offers reliability, flexibility, and strong support for complex data structures â€“ a perfect match for managing stock data.
- Gorilla Mux: To streamline our HTTP routing and middleware handling, we'll utilize the Gorilla Mux router, a popular choice in the Go community.
